# Microwave Theme for micro.blog
A card-based theme for your blog.

## Credits
The theme was heavily inspired by Jimmy Cai's `stack` theme for Hugo that can be found here: https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack

Search comes from the official Micro.blog search plugin by Manton Reece: https://github.com/microdotblog/plugin-search-page

Images page uses Masonry and ImagesLoaded from David SeSandro: https://github.com/desandro

The archive timeline is almost entirely built from this great codepen from Shireen Taj: https://codepen.io/TajShireen/pen/JjGvVzg

Mobile hamburger menu comes from Jonathan Suh here: https://github.com/jonsuh/hamburgers

## Features
* Additional social icons from micro.blog defaults
* Built-in search
* Custom tagline
* Support for replies
* Custom lightbox for photos in posts (supports multiple!)

## Customising
I've included SASS variables for the light and dark modes of the theme. Feel free to hack away at those and create alternative `bootstrap-dark` and `bootstrap-light` files.

#### Changing your tagline
Edit the config.json of your theme and change the value of `tagline`

#### Social Icons
I've only got a few of these right now - but edit your config.json with your username for each respective site and you'll get an icon. If you would like more adding to the theme, raise an issue in this repo and I'll get to it!
